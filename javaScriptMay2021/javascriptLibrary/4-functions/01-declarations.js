/*
FUNCTIONS
*/

//General Ideas: at their broadest level, functions to the following:
//1) they take some input, which the function will handle/process
//2) they process the input given to them
//3) they usually, but not always return some value
//4) they can be invoked (used) as many times as we want, cutting down on code repetition

//EXAMPLE 1:
function newFunc()
