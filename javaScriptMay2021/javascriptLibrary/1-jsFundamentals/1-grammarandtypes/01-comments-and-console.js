//console.log
//outputs some message to the console
console.log('this is a console.log message!');

console.log('you can separate parts of a console message with commas','just like this!'); //comma functions as a space and connects the two strings of text
//strings are text that interacts with the code

console.log(13,15,17,18);

//console.log and debugging
//we can debug with console.log message in 2 BIG ways:
//1. We can check the status of some javascript 'thing'
//2. We can check a process we have built with repeated console.log messages

//example 1:
var sampleName = 'Tyler';
console.log(sampleName);

//example 2: checking a process
var sampleNum = 1;
console.log(sampleNum);
sampleNum++; //adds 1 to the variable
console.log(sampleNum);
sampleNum++;
console.log(sampleNum);
